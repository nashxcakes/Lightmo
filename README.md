Lightmo v1.0 Readme
<br>By: Nash High

Lightmo is a color gradient program, designed to turn a computer monitor or 
television into a dynamic light source which gradually shifts in color.

If you want to try out one of the builds, use Lightmo-yourOS.jar--these are
self-contained, executable jars.

If you're on Windows and want to use Lightmo as your screen saver, download
Lightmo.scr and save it to your Windows/System32 folder. When you go to
set up your screen saver, you should see Lightmo as an option. When you select
it, Lightmo will automatically start--I apologize for this: it's a quirk with 
my packaging solution. Simply click or move the mouse to close it, then click
Apply or Okay to set your screen saver!

If you want to work with the code or make your own build, you will need 
<a href="http://slick.ninjacave.com/">Slick2D</a> and 
<a href="https://www.lwjgl.org/download">LWJGL</a>. Setting these up is a 
little tricky, but there are guides on the Slick2D website.
